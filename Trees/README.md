# Trees

## 1. Left View of a Binary Tree:
    Given a Binary Tree, print Left view of it. Left view of a Binary Tree is set of nodes visible when tree is visited from Left side. The task is to complete the function leftView(), which accepts root of the tree as argument.
    Left view of following tree is 1 2 4 8.
             1
            /     \
         2        3
        /     \    /    \
        4     5   6    7
        \
            8   

## 7. Lowest Common Ancestor in a BST:
    Given a Binary Search Tree (with all values unique) and two node values. Find the Lowest Common Ancestors of the two nodes in the BST.
    Example 1:
    Input:
              5
           /    \
         4       6
        /         \

                    \
                     8
    n1 = 7, n2 = 8
    Output: 7
