# Strings

## 1. Reverse words in a given string:
    Given a String S, reverse the string without reversing its individual words. Words are separated by dots.
    Example 1:
    Input:
    S = i.like.this.program.very.much
    Output: much.very.program.this.like.i
    Explanation: After reversing the whole string(not individual words), the input string becomes much.very.program.this.like.i
