## 1. Most Frequent Word In Array of Strings:
    Given an array arr containing N words consisting of lowercase characters. Your task is to find the most frequent word in the array. If multiple words have same frequency, then print the word whose first occurence occurs last in the array as compared to the other strings with same frequency.

    Input: N = 3 arr[] = {geeks,for,geeks}
    Output: geeks
    Explanation: "geeks" comes 2 times.

## 2. Camelcase Pattern Matching:
    Given a dictionary of words where each word follows CamelCase notation, print all words in the dictionary that match with a given pattern consisting of uppercase characters only.
    CamelCase is the practice of writing compound words or phrases such that each word or abbreviation begins with a capital letter. Common examples include: “PowerPoint” and “WikiPedia”, “GeeksForGeeks”, “CodeBlocks”, etc.
    Example 1:
    Input: N=3
        Dictionary=["WelcomeGeek", "WelcomeToGeeksForGeeks","GeeksForGeeks"]
        Pattern="WTG"
    Output: WelcomeToGeeksForGeeks
    Explanation: Since only WelcomeToGeeksForGeeks matches the pattern, it is the only answer.
