# Some more questions on Trees

## 1. Mirror Tree:
    Given a Binary Tree, convert it into its mirror.
    Example 1:
    Input:
          1
        /  \
       2    3
    Output: 2 1 3
    Explanation: The tree is
           1    (mirror)  1
         /  \    =>      /  \
        3    2          2    3
    The inorder of mirror is 2 1 3

## 2. Longest Consecutive Sequence in a Binary Tree:
    Given a Binary Tree find the length of the longest path which comprises of connected nodes with consecutive values in increasing order. 
    Example 1:
    Input :      
           1                               
         /   \                          
        2     3                      
    Output: 2
    Explanation : Longest sequence is 1, 2.
