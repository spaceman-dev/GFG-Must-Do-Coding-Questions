## 4. Longest Common Substring:
    Given two strings. The task is to find the length of the longest common substring.
    Example 1:
    Input: S1 = "ABCDGH", S2 = "ACDGHR"
    Output: 4
    Explanation: The longest common substring is "CDGH" which has length 4.

## 5. Longest Increasing Subsequence:
    Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest (strictly) increasing subsequence from the given array.
    Example 1:
    Input:
    N = 16
    A[]={0,8,4,12,2,10,6,14,1,9,5,13,3,11,7,15}
    Output: 6 
    Explanation:Longest increasing subsequence 0 2 6 9 13 15, which has length 6

## 6. Longest Common Subsequence:
    Given two sequences, find the length of longest subsequence present in both of them. Both the strings are of uppercase.
    Example 1:
    Input:
    A = 6, B = 6, str1 = ABCDGH, str2 = AEDFHR
    Output: 3
    Explanation: LCS for input Sequences “ABCDGH” and “AEDFHR” is “ADH” of length 3.
