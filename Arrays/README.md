# Arrays
## 1. Subarray With Given Sum: 
    Given an unsorted array A of size N that contains only non-negative integers, find a continuous sub-array which adds to a given number S.  
    Example 1:  
    Input:  
    N = 5, S = 12  
    A[] = {1,2,3,7,5}
    Output: 2 4  
    Explanation: The sum of elements from 2nd position to 4th position is 12.  

## 2. Count the triplets:
    Given an array of distinct integers. The task is to count all the triplets such that sum of two elements equals the third element.  
    Example 1:  
    Input:  
    N = 4  
    arr[] = {1, 5, 3, 2}  
    Output: 2  
    Explanation: There are 2 triplets: 1 + 2 = 3 and 3 + 2 = 5
