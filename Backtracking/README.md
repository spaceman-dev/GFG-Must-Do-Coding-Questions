## 1. N Queens Problem:
    The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on a (n×n) chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other.
    Given an integer n, find all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle. Each solution contains distinct board configurations of the n-queens’ placement, where the solutions are a permutation of [1,2,3..n] in increasing order, here the number in the ith place denotes that the ith-column queen is placed in the row with that number. 
    Example 1:
    Input: 4
    Output: [2 4 1 3 ] [3 1 4 2 ]
    Explaination: These are the 2 possible solutions.
