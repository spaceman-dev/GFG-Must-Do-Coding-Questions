# Bit Magic

## 1. Find first set bit:
    Given an integer an N. The task is to return the position of first set bit found from the right side in the binary representation of the number. Note: If there is no set bit in the integer N, then return 0 from the function.  
    Example 1:
    Input: N = 18
    Output: 2
    Explanation: Binary representation of 18 is 010010,the first set bit from the right side is at position 2.
