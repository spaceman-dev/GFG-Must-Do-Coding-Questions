# Bit Magic

## 1. Find first set bit:
    Given an integer an N. The task is to return the position of first set bit found from the right side in the binary representation of the number. Note: If there is no set bit in the integer N, then return 0 from the function.  
    Example 1:
    Input: N = 18
    Output: 2
    Explanation: Binary representation of 18 is 010010,the first set bit from the right side is at position 2.

## 2. Rightmost different bit:
    Given two numbers M and N. The task is to find the position of the rightmost different bit in the binary representation of numbers.
    Example 1: 
    Input: M = 11, N = 9
    Output: 2
    Explanation: Binary representation of the given numbers are: 1011 and 1001, 2nd bit from right is different.

## 3. Check whether Kth Bit is set or not:
    Given a number N and a bit number K, check if Kth bit of N is set or not. A bit is called set if it is 1. Position of set bit '1' should be indexed starting with 0 from LSB side in binary representation of the number.
    Example 1:
    Input: N = 4, K = 0
    Output: No  
    Explanation: Binary representation of 4 is 100, in which 0th bit from LSB is not set. So, return false.
